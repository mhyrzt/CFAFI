## What is this project?

If you are Iranian you may now due to the sanction Iranians cant purchase any of the courses ON coursera & also and also since dollar price is high in iran maybe not all of us can spend that much money because of out financial situation.


coursera provides an opportunity for you to enroll in a course for free via their financial aid. You can acquire a financial aid by writing them a letter (max of 150 words) and tell them why  you can't afford the prices and need financial aid
